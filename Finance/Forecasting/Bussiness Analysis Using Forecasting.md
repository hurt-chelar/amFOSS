### Basic Definitons 
Time Series : Measurement of a phenomenon taken over a period of time 

Time series forcasting : predicting future values for these things 


Predict vs Forecast  
+ Predict means : trying to predict when we have data on many things at one point of time 
+ ForeCase means : trying to measure 1 thing over time. 


discreptive vs predictive 

discriptive : Time series anlaysis 
+ discribing patterns in historical data 
predicitive: Time series prediction 
+ predicting future value of the series

Impute - means forecasting a past data, one that could be lost due to corrouption of data or anything like that. 

*Delay in the system
+ Hence it is really important to keep in mind the deployment schenario
